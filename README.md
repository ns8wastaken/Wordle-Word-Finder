### Word list source

Source: SCOWL/12dicts word lists.

Subset: **3of6game**
Documentation: http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts-readme/#3of6game

The repository does **not** ship the original corpus.
The files in `src/assets/wordlists/` are generated by `tools/word_file_converter.py` from the upstream dataset and filtered to the game’s word length rules.

To regenerate:
```
./build.sh
```
